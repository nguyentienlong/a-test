### A test that I took when interviewing with iprice team

----------
**input**: a random text

**requirement**: shift vowels in random text forward n times

**output**: a shifted text of input text

eg:

before: this is a text
after calling function: this as e tixt

----------

**implementation** 

in `shift.php` - complexcity is O(n*n)

in `shift2.php` - complexcity is O(n)

in `shipt3.php` - O(n) only use one loop

run: 
`php shift.php "this is a text" 1`
